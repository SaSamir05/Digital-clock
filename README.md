A simple **digital clock** program written in C that displays the current time in **HH:MM:SS** format and updates every second. Perfect for beginners learning C programming and console-based applications.

---

## Features

- Real-time display of hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Automatically increments time and rolls over after 24 hours.
- Console-based, lightweight, and simple.
- Works on **Windows** (`cls`) and **Linux** (`clear`) with minor changes.

---

## Demo

Here is an example of how the clock looks while running:

```

00 : 00 : 01
00 : 00 : 02
00 : 00 : 03
...

````

*Tip: You can add a screenshot of your console output here for more visual appeal.*

## How It Works

1. Initializes `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds` to `0`.
2. Runs an infinite loop to update the time every second.
3. Clears the console on each iteration using:
   - `system("cls");` for Windows
   - `system("clear");` for Linux
4. Increments seconds, and rolls over minutes and hours when necessary.
5. Prints formatted time with `printf("%02d : %02d : %02d\n", hours, minutes, seconds);`.

## Usage

### Compile

```bash
gcc digital_clock.c -o digital_clock
````

### Run

```bash
./digital_clock   # Linux
digital_clock.exe # Windows
```

## Notes

* Adjust `system("cls")` or `system("clear")` according to your OS.
* The clock starts at `00:00:00` each time it runs.
* Uses `sleep(1)` to pause 1 second between updates. On Windows, you may need to include `<windows.h>` and use `Sleep(1000)` instead.
